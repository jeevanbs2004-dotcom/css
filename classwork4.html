      A blood donation camp is being organized by the school's Red Cross Club on October 30th, 2025, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM in the school auditorium.
     Students aged 18 and above are encouraged to participate.There will be a mandatory fire safety drill on November 5th, 2025, at 11:00 AM. All employees must evacuate the building and proceed to the assembly point.
      A brown leather wallet containing a student ID card and a small amount of cash was found near the school cafeteria during lunch hour today. The owner is requested to report to the school office to claim it, after providing proper identification.
     The honesty of the student who submitted the wallet is highly appreciated. Please remember that all lost and found items should be turned into the school office to ensure they are returned to their rightful owners as quickly as possible. We encourage all students to follow this example of integrity.
